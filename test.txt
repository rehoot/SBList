This is a small text file that is used to test the 
sbed03.py text editor, which is full of bugs.
Your screen needs to be big to run this.
Use vim-like commands: i=insert, k=up, j=down

run something like this from the UNIX command line:
  
  env python sbed03.py -f test.txt

This file might need to have only a small
number of lines,
